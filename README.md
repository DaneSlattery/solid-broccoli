# solid-broccoli

A c++ implementation of the classic game, snake.

The purpose of this program is to test and apply my own knowledge of 
game creation, search algorithms, pathing algorithms and AI in general.

It is hoped that the game will have a server, with which the player can 
interact through the keyboard, showing their actions on screen. This 
same interaction of standard input shall be used by the AI client, of 
which there will be many, all competing within the same playing field.

The compiler is g++.

Feel free to make suggestions as I am still learning.
